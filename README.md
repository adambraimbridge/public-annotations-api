cd ./public-annotations-api
./public-annotations-api --neo-url={neo4jUrl} --port={port} --log-level={DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR}--cache-duration{e.g. 22h10m3s}
```

```sh

--cache-duration defaults to 1 hour._
```

* `curl http://localhost:8080/content/143ba45c-2fb3-35bc-b227-a6ed80b5c517/annotations | json_pp`
* Or using [httpie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) `http GET http://localhost:8080/content/143ba45c-2fb3-35bc-b227-a6ed80b5c517/annotations`

## Testing

* Run unit tests only: `go test -race ./...`
* Run unit and integration tests:

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose-tests.yml up -d --build && \
docker logs -f test-runner && \
docker-compose -f docker-compose-tests.yml down
```

## Build & deployment

Continuosly built by CircleCI. The docker image of the service is built by Dockerhub based on the git release tag.
To prepare a new git release, go to the repo page on GitHub and create a new release.

## API definition

Based on the following [google doc](https://docs.google.com/a/ft.com/document/d/1kQH3tk1GhXnupHKdDhkDE5UyJIHm2ssWXW3zjs3g2h8/edit?usp=sharing)

### GET content/{uuid}/annotations endpoint

Returns all annotations for a given uuid of a piece of content in json format.

*Please note* that

* the `public-annotations-api` will return more brands than the ones the article has been annotated with.
This is because it will return also the parent of the brands from any brands annotations.
If those brands have parents, then they too will be brought into the result.

* the `public-annotations-api` uses annotations lifecycle to determine which annotations are returned. If curated (tag-me) annotations (lifecycle pac) for a piece of content exist, they will be returned combined with V2 annotations by default, other non-pac lifecycle annotations are omitted.
If there are no pac lifecycle annotations, non-pac annotations will be returned. The filtering described in the next paragraph relates to non-pac annotations. Additional filtering by annotations lifecycle could be applied using the optional "lifecycle" query parameter.

* the `public-annotations-api` will filter out less important annotations if a more important annotation is also present for the same concept.  
_For example_, if a piece of content is annotated with a concept with "About", "Major Mentions" and "Mentions" relationships
only the annotation with "About" relationship will be returned.
Similarly if a piece of content is annotated with a Concept "Is Classified By" and "Is Primarily Classified By"
only the annotation with "Is Primarily Classified By" relationship will be returned.

## Admin endpoints

* Healthchecks: [http://localhost:8080/__health](http://localhost:8080/__health)  
* Build Info: [http://localhost:8080/__build-info](http://localhost:8080/__build-info)  
* GTG: [http://localhost:8080/__gtg](http://localhost:8080/__gtg)

### Logging

The application uses logrus, the logfile is initialised in main.go.

Logging requires an env app parameter: for all environments other than local, logs are written to file. When running locally logging
is written to console (if you want to log locally to file you need to pass in an env parameter that is != local).

NOTE: <http://localhost:8080/__gtg> end point is not logged as it is called every second from varnish and this information is not needed in logs/splunk
